    <h2>What is a Fancy Rat?</h2>
    <p>Fancy rats are the domestic variety of the Norway rat. They’re psychologically and physiologically different from their wild cousins. They’re sociable and playful, and it’s best to keep a pair of rats so they have company. <br><br></p>
    <p>Fancy rats are sociable, playful, intelligent, and affectionate. They make wonderful pets, so if you’ve been considering adding a pet rat (or two!) to your family, then you’re in the right place. Fancy rats are gentle and make great small pets for kids, as they’re easier to handle and more playful than the more popular hamster!<br><br></p>
